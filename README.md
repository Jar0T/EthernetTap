<h2>How to setup and test data exporting</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Have a MS SQL Server ready - preferably a local one managed by MS SQL Server Management Studio or maybe one created by Visual Studio.</li>
  <li>Your Windows user should have all the permissions by default but keep that in mind.</li>
  <li>Open the application and go to the export page.</li>
  <li>Tick the checkbox for database export and provide server address and database name. By default it's the local server address and "EthernetTap" database.</li>
  <li>Click the button to check the connection. You should be prompted to create the database if it doesn't exist.</li>
  <li>Click the button to confirm the address and the name.</li>
  <li>Go and configure filters and start to capture frames.</li>
  <li>Look for new entities in the three created tables in the database. For local server this can be checked in the Management Studio or in Visual Studio.</li>
  <li>Report all bugs to the SCRUM MATSRE</li>
  <li>???</li>
  <li>Profit.</li>
